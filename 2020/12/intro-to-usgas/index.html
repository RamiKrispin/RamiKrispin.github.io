<p>Happy to announce that the <a href="https://ramikrispin.github.io/USgas/">USgas</a> package is now on CRAN. The package provides an overview of natural gas demand in the US in a time-series format (state and aggregate levels), with more than 100 series.</p>
<p>This package is a mirror of the <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/USgrid">USgrid</a> package that focuses on electricity demand (and supply) in the US. Additional information available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source code - <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/USgas" class="uri">https://github.com/RamiKrispin/USgas</a></li>
<li>Package site - <a href="https://ramikrispin.github.io/USgas/" class="uri">https://ramikrispin.github.io/USgas/</a></li>
<li>Data source - US Energy Information Administration, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/" class="uri">https://www.eia.gov/</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="datasets" class="section level3">
<h3>Datasets</h3>
<p>Currently, there are three datasets in the package:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>us_monthly</code> - The monthly demand for natural gas in the US between 2001 and 2020</li>
<li><code>us_total</code> - The US annual natural gas consumption by state-level between 1997 and 2019, and aggregate level between 1949 and 2019</li>
<li><code>us_residential</code> - The US monthly natural gas residential consumption by state and aggregate level between 1989 and 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>While the first dataset describes only the US consumption, the second and third describe total and residential consumption by state, respectively.</p>
<div id="visualize-the-demand-for-natural-gas" class="section level4">
<h4>Visualize the demand for natural gas</h4>
<p>The <code>us_monthly</code> dataset is a monthly series, representing the total demand (or consumption) of natural gas in the US since 2001:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(USgas)

data(&quot;us_monthly&quot;)

head(us_monthly)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         date       y
## 1 2001-01-01 2676998
## 2 2001-02-01 2309464
## 3 2001-03-01 2246633
## 4 2001-04-01 1807170
## 5 2001-05-01 1522382
## 6 2001-06-01 1444378</code></pre>
<p>Let’s use <strong>plotly</strong> to visualize the series:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(plotly)

plot_ly(data = us_monthly,
        x = ~ date,
        y = ~ y,

        mode = &quot;line&quot;) %&gt;%
  layout(title = &quot;US Monthly Natural Gas Consumption&quot;,
         yaxis = list(title = &quot;Million Cubic Feet&quot;),
         xaxis = list(title = &quot;Source: US Energy Information Administration&quot;))</code></pre>

<p>Last but not least is the <code>us_residential</code> dataset, which describes the monthly demand for natural gas by residential consumers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(&quot;us_residential&quot;)

head(us_residential)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         date   state    y
## 1 1989-01-01 Alabama 7406
## 2 1989-02-01 Alabama 7044
## 3 1989-03-01 Alabama 7392
## 4 1989-04-01 Alabama 4722
## 5 1989-05-01 Alabama 2856
## 6 1989-06-01 Alabama 1709</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, we can plot the residential demand for natural gas in the West Cost states:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
